# APIs-for-Data-Science-with-Python
In this repository, I demonstrate how Pandas, a python library can be used as an API as well as other free APIs such as the Coingecko and NBA_API.

<b>An API lets two pieces of software talk to each other. Just like a function, you don't have to know how the API works, only its inputs and outputs. An essential type of API is a REST API that allows you to access resources via the internet. In this project, I will review the Pandas Library in the context of an API, we will also review a basic REST API
